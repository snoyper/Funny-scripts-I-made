// i really like blooket, but i like haxing it more, i made this poopoo script to make it easier.  it will just put a thing in the corner of the screen.
javascript:var frame = document.createElement('iframe'); frame.src="https://webcamtoy.com/"; frame.style.position="fixed"; frame.style.top="5%"; frame.style.right="0%";frame.style.height="300px";frame.style.width="315px"; frame.style.zIndex="100000"; document.body.appendChild(frame);
// this script does not show up on search history so nobody will know you are hacking so its better then just going to the website

// i found a problem    you have to open it in a different tab because  "blooket blocked it"  :(
